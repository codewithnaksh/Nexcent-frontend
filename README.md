# 🖥️ Figma to Code: Landing Page (HTML + CSS)

This project is a fully responsive **Landing Page** meticulously converted from a **Figma design** to production-ready **HTML and CSS**.  
It reflects my ability to accurately interpret design specs, manage layout hierarchies, and write clean, maintainable code.
